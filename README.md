# Project: Building with Backgrounds and Gradients.

> This is a personal project I built for the Microverse Main Curriculum course. It is meant to showcase everything I've learned about background images, gradients, and building layouts with these features.

The assignment for the project was to build a clone of an old version of Apple's website, linked [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/). 
The site looks simple enough at first sight, but I did run into a couple of complications trying to adjust the sizes of the containers to make the background images fit.
The navbar section also looks deceptively simple, but it took a lot of work to make it look right, especially the last item to the right, which holds a search box.
